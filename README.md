# My First Portfolio ðŸŒŸ

This is my **first portfolio project**!  
I built it using only **HTML** and **CSS**, with just a little bit of **JavaScript** to make it interactive.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Simple and clean design
- Fully responsive layout
- Small JavaScript enhancements

## ðŸ“– About
This project is my starting point in web development.  
I wanted to practice the basics of **front-end development** and showcase what Iâ€™ve learned so far.

## ðŸ’¡ Next Steps
In the future, Iâ€™d like to:
- Add more sections and projects
- Improve the design with animations
- Learn and use more JavaScript
